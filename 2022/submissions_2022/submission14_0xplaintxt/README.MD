## What is Colombo Coin?

CC is a whimsical ERC-20 token that will be airdropped to verified EOAs who have burned the most cumulative gas interacting with UniV2 to-date (snapshot date: 02/02/2022).

The gas burned by these EOAs represents a steep sacrifice made by early pioneers in DeFi to bootstrap liquidity across the ETH mainnet.

The goal of the Colombo team is to reward these early adopters and provide a utility token for a novel cross-chain exchange to be deployed in Q2'22, designed expressly to serve the early and the brave.

In the near term, those who stake their CC in liquidity pools such as UniV2 will also receive further incentives denominated in CC for continuing to provide critical liquidity services to the market. We anticipate broad demand for OTC CC and will enthusiastically reward all liquidity providers who help broaden our ecosystem. We have also built some novel functionality into the core ERC-20 implementation to support our future rewards scheme; we look forward to unveiling the reward function when the broader Colombo platform launches. For now we simply hope you enjoy some wonderful and enigmatic variable names.

Our roadmap is long and winding and we look forward to a fruitful future together!
