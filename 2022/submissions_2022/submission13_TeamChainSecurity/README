UniswapV2 but better
--------------------

UniswapV2 is great. We made it even better:

- Overall reduced gas consumption
  - Actual DEX only uses a single storage slot
  - For single-pair swaps the Router is integrated with the pair, hence you don't need to interact with the Router and save significantly thanks to EIP-2929.
  - Doesn't require approving the LP token before the burn
- Allows unbalanced addition of liquidity (who has tokens in perfect ratio?)
- LP Minting fees (as unbalaned minting is allowed) to prevent Just-in-Time liquidity
- New Error codes to reduce code size
- Streamlined the code by removing unnecessary checks
- Removed rarely used oracle
- Restricted to reasonable subset of ERC20 to simplify code
- No extra fees EVER
