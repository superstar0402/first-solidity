# Wrappers

Do you know what DeFi needs ? I'll tell you what DeFi needs.

DeFi needs _in cen tives_. We're not changing the world yet, we're not onboarding the millions of users we want.

And you know what ? Top DEXes such as Uniswap are not doing anything to help onboard the masses.

But we are. Hell we are.

Plain and simple: we're paying ETH to folks using our wrapper built on top of Uniswap V2 pools. No memecoin, no pump-and-dump schemes. You swap using the wrapper, we reward you with good old ETH. This is our contribution to bring the next generation of users into DeFi.

Following our auditors recommendations, the wrapper supports blue-chip stablecoins: DAI, USDC and USDT. Simply select which one you want. You can also provide the usual parameters you'd see in Uniswap V2.

If you don't like these coins, but still want to try this contract, you can use it to buy our recently launched stablecoin STL. But since our coin is still experimental, we're only paying rewards for swaps in DAI, USDC and USDT - coins that everybody knows and trust.

The contract is dead simple, and all you need to do is call the `swapExactETHForTokens` function choosing the stablecoin and whatever parameters you want to pass to Uniswap.

Oh, and one last thing. Our wrapper is _fully permissionless_. We don't have any powers over the contract. Once we deploy it, it'll be live _forever_. Of course we will be continuosuly providing ETH to the contract so that rewards are always paid - but _anybody_ in the community can do it if we can't. And if for any reason there's no rewards available, don't worry, you can still use it.

Happy swapping!
