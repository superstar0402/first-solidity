# Decentralized NFT Exchange

This contract allows sellers to list their NFTs for sale and allows buyers to pay Ether for NFT. It is simple, flexible and decentralized.

Benefits for sellers:
* Sellers don't have to escrow their NFTs into the contract for listing. They just need approve the contract to transfer. So their NFTs are still safe in their wallet before selling them.
* Sellers have to set the price denominated in Wei for listing. And they can change the price at any time.
* Sellers can reset the approval if they want to unlist their NFTs.

Benefits for buyers:
* Buyers don't have to wrap Ether. They can pay native Ether for any NFTs on sale.
* Buyers don't have to escrow Ether to trade NFTs. They receive what they want immediately when they pay.

Oops! There is a flaw on this contract. The flaw is described in [spoiler.txt](./spoiler.txt)
